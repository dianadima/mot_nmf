function [h] = plotBarStackGroups(stackData, groupLabels)
%% Plot a set of stacked bars, but group them according to labels provided.
%%
%% Params: 
%%      stackData is a 3D matrix (i.e., stackData(i, j, k) => (Group, Stack, StackElement)) 
%%      groupLabels is a CELL type (i.e., { 'a', 1 , 20, 'because' };)
